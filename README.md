# Flask Text Summarizer Web App

This app uses a simple extractive NLP method to summarize text. Any English language text can be input and the app will return a summary of three sentences.

## How Do I Use This Thing?

There's three steps to summarize your text:

1. Enter some text
2. Select the length
3. Select Summarize

And you're good to go!

## What this is and what it isn't
The app lets you:
✅ Summarize English-language text
✅ Find the _key_ sentences that best represent the topic of the data
✅ Use simple math through term frequency (with some weighting) to gain and understanding of the text

The app isn't:
❌ An abstractive text summary - meaning it doesn't glean new meaning from the text
❌ The best solution out there (sadly!)
