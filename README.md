# Flask Text Summarizer Web App

This app uses a simple extractive NLP method to summarize text. Any English language text can be input and the app will return a summary. The app lets you input how long your summary should be and will default to three sentences.

## How Do I Use This Thing?

There's three steps to summarize your text:

1. Enter some text
2. Select the length
3. Select Summarize

And you're good to go!

## What this is and what it isn't
The app lets you:\
✅ Summarize English-language text\
✅ Find the _key_ sentences that best represent the topic of the data\
✅ Use simple math through term frequency (with some weighting) to gain and understanding of the text\

The app isn't:\
❌ An abstractive text summary - meaning it doesn't glean new meaning from the text\
❌ The best solution out there (sadly!)\
❌ An ordered solution (i.e., the order of the text isn't taken into account), which may result in some odd behavior
